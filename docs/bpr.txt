BPM's register


This file format is a generic way to store data in key-pairs values, with difererent "types".

The basic structure of a >bpr< file is defined by this simple format:
>extension-type key=value<

The >extension-type< can implement rules for that entry. Ex:
  - The extension type can add prefixes or sufixes to the loaded data
  - It can also check if the key or values is invalid for semantic reasons
  - It can manipulate the loaded key or value if necessary

>Where it is used by bpm?<
All BPM's repositories need to use this format, implementing two simple extensions for "bpr-repo":
  'metadata' -> Loads repo name and author's name for each repo
  'entry'    -> Stores package's name and url to be installed
