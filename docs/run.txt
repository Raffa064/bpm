Run bpm packages

bpm run [package name]

To run a bpm project, it's >package.sh< might specify the main script as follows:

  >pkg[main]='com.pkg.name.script' # -> src/com/pkg/name/script.sh< 

>NOTE:< The main script must have a main function namespaced with package's name:

  Examples:
  -  yourPkgName/main
  -  bpm/main
  -  project/main

The >package name< param allows to run any package from anywhere, but if it's not specified, it will try to run the current dir as a package dir. If you aren't inside a package dir, it will display an error message.
