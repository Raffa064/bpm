Package Installer

bpm install [(package_names...)]

Used to install packages.

If you are inside the >package directory< and run "bpm install" without any arguments, it will check for all dependencies defined in the >package.sh<, installing them if needed. Similarly, if you are inside a valid package directory, you can run it with one or more package names as arguments, and all of them will be added to the >package.sh< and installed in sequence.

However, if you aren't inside a package directory, it will only install the packages passed as arguments. In this case, the arguments will be mandatory.

>Note:< All packages installed by bpm will be stored at "$HOME/.local/.bpm/deps" for global use. Note that, local packages will not be moved to the deps dir, so you need to ensure that they are indexed by "bpm locator", you can learn more about it in the >locator< help section.
